This is a smart contract written in Solidity. It defines a token called "DEGEN" (symbol "DGN") with a maximum total supply of 100,000. The contract includes standard ERC20 functions for transferring, approving, and burning tokens, as well as additional functions for minting new tokens, buying a "gun" (which requires 500 DEGEN tokens), and reloading ammo (which requires 100 DEGEN tokens).

Here's a breakdown of the contract's functions:

1. balanceOf: Returns the token balance of a given address.
2. transfer: Transfers tokens from the caller to a specified address.
3. approve: Approves a specified address to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the caller.
4. allowance: Returns the remaining amount of tokens that a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of a given address.
5. transferFrom: Transfers tokens from a specified address to another address, using the allowance mechanism.
6. burn: Destroys a specified amount of tokens from the caller's balance.
7. mint: Creates new tokens and assigns them to a specified address (only callable by the contract owner).
8. buyGun: Allows the caller to purchase a "gun" by spending 500 DEGEN tokens.
9. reload: Allows the caller to reload ammo by spending 100 DEGEN tokens (only if they own a gun and have enough tokens).
